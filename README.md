# End-to-end-Machine-Learning-Project-on-Loan-Prediction-System.
Problem Statement:
Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still do not have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. The two most critical questions in the lending industry are:

How risky is the borrower?
Given the borrower’s risk, should we lend him/her?
In the modern era, the data science teams in the banks build predictive models using machine learning to predict how likely a client is going to default the loan when they only have a handful of information. Loan Prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces at least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.


Goal of this Project:
he primary objective of this project, titled "Loan Status Prediction," was to automate and streamline the loan eligibility process in real-time. By leveraging customer details provided during the online application process, such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant factors, the project aimed to accurately classify loan applications into approved or rejected categories.


Here's a breakdown of the major steps involved in the project:


1.Introduction: I began by introducing the project and outlining the significance of loan approval prediction in the financial industry.


2.Business Problem: I delved into the specific problem we aimed to address - automating the loan eligibility process based on customer details.


3.Importing Modules: I imported the necessary modules and libraries required for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.


4.Dataset Analysis: I performed an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into its structure, characteristics, and any initial challenges that needed to be addressed.


5.Handling Missing Values: I dealt with missing values present in both categorical and numerical variables by employing suitable techniques for imputation.

6.Detection and Handling of Outliers: I identified and addressed outliers, ensuring that they did not adversely impact the models' performance.

7.Analysis of Categorical Data with Target: I examined the relationship between categorical variables and the loan approval status to understand their impact on the prediction outcome.

8.Data Preparation: I prepared the dataset for model training by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

9.Handling Imbalanced Data: I addressed the issue of imbalanced data by employing techniques like oversampling or undersampling to ensure fair representation of both approved and rejected loan applications.

10.Creating Multiple Models and Choosing the Ideal One: I built various classification models, including DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier. These models were evaluated based on their performance metrics and their ability to accurately predict loan approval status.

11.Model Building: After evaluating the models, I selected Decision Tree Classifier as the best model for our project due to its effective training and testing accuracy. This model demonstrated the highest level of performance and reliability in predicting loan approval outcomes.

By employing this comprehensive approach, the project aimed to provide financial institutions with a reliable and efficient tool to automate their loan approval process, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions while minimizing manual effort and bias.

I'm excited about the successful completion of this project and the potential positive impact it can have on the lending industry.
