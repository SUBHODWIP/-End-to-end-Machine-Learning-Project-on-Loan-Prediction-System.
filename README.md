# End-to-end-Machine-Learning-Project-on-Loan-Prediction-System.
Problem Statement:
Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still do not have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. The two most critical questions in the lending industry are:

How risky is the borrower?
Given the borrower’s risk, should we lend him/her?
In the modern era, the data science teams in the banks build predictive models using machine learning to predict how likely a client is going to default the loan when they only have a handful of information. Loan Prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces at least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.

Goal of this Project:
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban, and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.

To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers’ segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.
